# Contributing to Finly

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Finly. This project is intentionally small, local-only, and beginner-friendly. Contributions that improve usability, documentation, or stability are most welcome.

Guidelines
- Respect the offline-first philosophy: do not add network calls, telemetry, or external services.
- Keep changes small and focused. If you want to add a feature, open an issue first to discuss the design.
- Write clear, beginner-friendly commit messages and include short explanations for non-trivial changes.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes locally. Keep logic and UI changes small and easy to review.
3. Run a basic syntax check:

```bash
python -m py_compile expense_tracker/*.py
```

4. Commit and push your branch, then open a pull request describing the change.

Reporting bugs
- Open an issue and include steps to reproduce, Python version, OS, and any relevant error messages.

Coding style
- The project uses simple and readable Python. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

Thank you for helping make Finly better!
